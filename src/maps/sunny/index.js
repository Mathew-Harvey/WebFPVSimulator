/*
 * index.js: Sunnyfield as a map, built the way Joshua Bardwell's house is
 * (../bardwell/index.js): the built map's pipeline (../built/index.js) does
 * all of it, the sky, the ground, the ink, the shadows, the colliders, the
 * cull, the named gaps, the cars, the marks. This file hands it the town's
 * document (./yard.js) and the town itself (./plan.js) as one structure of
 * its own, draws what the parts cannot say, hangs the signs (./signs.js),
 * lights the steam, smoke and fire (./fx.js), and names the world.
 *
 * WHAT THE DRAW ADDS, in the world frame, after the kit has drawn every
 * part the town marks as drawn: the roofs' slopes and gables (prisms), the
 * round things (cyls, discs, balls, cones), the cooling towers' shells, the
 * rings (tori: the donut, the tyres, the towers' rims), the hill's banks and
 * the big house's roof (frusta), and the town's own trees and cars
 * (scaled). Each in the chunk ./frame.js files its place under, which the
 * pipeline also files the parts and the document's assets by (chunkOf), so
 * the town is six cull cells and six batches a colour, not fifty four.
 *
 * THE GORGE is cut out of the ground's two planes (openGround), and its
 * floor is the ground the plant is given there (extra.floor), as Heads'
 * basement is. The roads' own mesh is hidden: the streets are the town's
 * paint (./streets.js), and the two roads are only the lanes the cars
 * drive (./plan.js trafficLoops).
 *
 * On Low, what the town marks `fine` is not drawn: window frames, sills,
 * sprinkles, rungs. Nothing fine is solid, so the flight is the same.
 *
 * THE SET DRESSING (./dress.js: the yards' toys and furniture, the shops'
 * roofs and backs, the street furniture, the clutter of the plant, the
 * dump and the park) is fine and near: Low draws none of it, and High and
 * Medium draw it in forty eight cells of their own (./frame.js nearOf), each
 * switched off past NEAR_R from the camera (nearCull), every frame after
 * the pipeline's cull. Its draws are paid for by the palette merge
 * (./palette.js), which folds the leaf batches of a chunk together.
